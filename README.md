# Mn10's Building Repository
Welcome to my repository. This place is intended to be used for storing my WIP buildings to allow
me to rollback if needed. However, if you have a recent official release of my IP installed, and
enough patience, you may download a WIP building file for experimental purposes.

REMINDER:
If you download a building from here and it does not load, or load with missing textures,
it is recommended that you wait for me to make an official release at the forum.
