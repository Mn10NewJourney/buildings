# Mn10's Building Repository
Welcome to my repository. This place is intended to be used for storing my WIP buildings to allow
me to rollback if needed. However, if you have a recent official release of my IP installed, and
enough patience, you may download a WIP building file for experimental purposes.

Due to copyright reasons, this repo contains only the buildings I created by myself and Simple mods.
If you download a building from here and it does not load, or load with missing textures, you are
recommended to wait for me to make an official release (with all data) at the forum.

Once again, please directly or indirectly credit me in your videos/photos for any captures of my creations,
and don't post my buildings or contents as your own without making noticeable edits to such files.
