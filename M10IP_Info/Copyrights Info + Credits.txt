D. Credits for formerly used contents
	D1. Details
	-These contents were used in older releases of my buildings (from the old forum), but no longer used in newer releases.
	-However, sometimes in 2021-2022, I was concerned that some users might suddenly pop up from their inactivity and ask me to remove any file.
	-Therefore, I opted to use some textures in SVN instead. Unused contents, such as some elevator fixtures, were also removed.

	D2. Credits
	(All of these details are provided for people who may have older version of my buildings that rely on these contents.)
	(Also, if I change my mind and decide to use those contents again, I will move the content owners' names to section B or C above.)

	-Credit is given to Samuel (sumosoftinc) for the Sigma Palladium call buttons.
