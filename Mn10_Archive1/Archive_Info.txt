The recent development of the simulator has broken several buildings. Due to this, I cannot keep on editing every single building of mine to work on the new builds released since August 2025, as this will render the buildings broken on any older builds released before the "Planets" feature's debut.

Therefore, I decided to archive certain buildings from the past to help identify the buildings which will not be updated anymore, enabling users to determine the most suitable build of Skyscraper to run their preferred buildings.
