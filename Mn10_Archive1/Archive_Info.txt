Information for the "Mn10_Archive1" and "Mn10_Archive2" folders:

The recent development of the simulator has broken several buildings. Due to this, I cannot keep on editing all of my buildings to work on any new build released since August 2025, as this will render them broken on any older build released prior to the "Planets" feature's debut.

Therefore, I decided to archive certain buildings from the past to help identify the buildings which will not be updated anymore, enabling users to determine the most suitable build of Skyscraper to run their preferred buildings. This also helps me to more easily identify the main buildings I should focus on.

To see the archived buildings, please move (or copy) all the related building and script files to your main "buildings" folder.
